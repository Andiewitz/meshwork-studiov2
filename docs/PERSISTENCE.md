## Overview

Canvas persistence uses a **two-layer hybrid model**: local browser storage as a fast, instant fail-safe, and PostgreSQL as the long-term source of truth. The two layers are carefully coordinated so data is never lost, even if the network drops or the user navigates away mid-edit.

```
User makes a change
        │
        ▼
localStorage updated immediately ◄── instant, zero network
        │
        ▼ (after 3 seconds of inactivity)
API sync: POST /api/workspaces/:id/sync-canvas
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
Success?     Fail?
   │             │
Cache cleared   Cache kept
(DB is now      (retry on next
 authoritative)  change)
```

## The Hybrid Persistence Model

### Why Two Layers?

| Scenario | Without Cache | With Cache |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| User refreshes before auto-save fires | ❌ Work lost | ✅ Restored from localStorage |
| Network drops mid-session | ❌ Sync fails silently | ✅ Cache persists, syncs when online |
| Browser crashes | ❌ Work lost | ✅ Restored on next open |
| Server is temporarily down | ❌ All changes lost | ✅ Local work preserved |

### Coordination Contract

- The local cache is written **on every change**, immediately.
- The cache is **only cleared** on a confirmed successful database sync.
- If the DB sync fails, the cache is preserved — it will retry on the next change cycle.
- On workspace load, if a local cache exists for that workspace, it is loaded instead of the stale database version.

---

## Local Cache Layer

### Implementation

**File:** `client/src/lib/canvas-cache.ts`

```typescript
export const CANVAS_CACHE_PREFIX = "meshwork-canvas-cache-";

export interface CanvasCache {
    nodes: any[];
    edges: any[];
    timestamp: number; // Unix ms — used to detect if cache is newer than DB
}

export function saveCanvasToLocalCache(workspaceId: number, nodes: any[], edges: any[])
export function getCanvasFromLocalCache(workspaceId: number): CanvasCache | null
export function clearCanvasLocalCache(workspaceId: number): void
```

### Storage Key Format

Each workspace gets its own isolated key:
```
meshwork-canvas-cache-{workspaceId}
```

For example, workspace `42` is stored at `meshwork-canvas-cache-42`. This means:
- Multiple workspaces can have independent caches simultaneously
- Clearing workspace 42's cache doesn't affect workspace 43's cache
- Cache entries are workspace-scoped, not user-scoped (the user is implicitly identified by the session)

### Error Handling

All three functions wrap their `localStorage` calls in `try/catch`. If `localStorage` is unavailable (e.g., private browsing mode with storage blocked, or quota exceeded), functions fail silently with a `console.warn`. The app continues to function — it just loses the local cache layer.

```typescript
export function saveCanvasToLocalCache(workspaceId: number, nodes: any[], edges: any[]) {
    try {
        const cache: CanvasCache = { nodes, edges, timestamp: Date.now() };
        localStorage.setItem(`${CANVAS_CACHE_PREFIX}${workspaceId}`, JSON.stringify(cache));
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn("Failed to save canvas to local cache", e);
    }
}
```

## Database Sync Layer

### Auto-Save Trigger

In `Workspace.tsx`, a `useEffect` watches the `nodes` and `edges` state. When they change:
1. The local cache is updated **immediately** (`saveCanvasToLocalCache`)
2. A **3-second debounce timer** is set
3. When the debounce fires, `sync({ nodes, edges })` is called — the TanStack Query mutation that POSTs to the API

```typescript
// On every nodes/edges change:
saveCanvasToLocalCache(workspaceId, nodes, edges);   // instant
debouncedSync(nodes, edges);                          // fires after 3s of no further changes
```

### Sync Mutation (`use-canvas.ts`)

```typescript
const syncMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async ({ nodes, edges }) => {
        // Normalize animated property for Postgres compatibility
        const normalizedEdges = edges.map(edge => ({
            ...edge,
            animated: edge.animated ? 1 : 0   // boolean → integer
        }));
        const res = await apiRequest("POST", url, { nodes, edges: normalizedEdges });
        return res.json();
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
        clearCanvasLocalCache(workspaceId);   // Only cleared on success
        queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [url] });
    },
});
```

## Save Status Indicators

The UI shows a live status indicator in the workspace toolbar:

| Status | When | Display |
|--------|------|---------|
| `saved` | After a successful DB sync | ✅ Saved |
| `saving` | While the API request is in flight | 🔄 Saving... |
| `offline_saved` | API failed — data is in local cache | 💾 Saved Locally |

The status resets to `offline_saved` if the user makes changes while offline (the debounce fires but the network request fails). This gives the user confidence their work is preserved even without a database connection.

---

## Edge Normalization Fix

### The Bug

PostgreSQL's `animated` column in the `edges` table is typed as `INTEGER` (0 or 1). React Flow sets `edge.animated` to a JavaScript boolean (`true` / `false`). When a boolean was sent directly to PostgreSQL, it threw:

```
invalid input syntax for type integer: "false"
```

### The Fix

Before syncing to the API, all edges are normalized in `use-canvas.ts`:

```typescript
const normalizedEdges = edges.map(edge => ({
    ...edge,
    animated: edge.animated ? 1 : 0
}));
```

This happens transparently before every sync — the React Flow state still uses booleans internally, only the API payload uses integers.

## Testing

**File:** `tests/unit/workspace/canvas-cache.test.ts`

These 5 tests verify all critical paths of the local cache:

| Test | What It Proves |
|------|---------------|
| *Should save canvas data with a timestamp* | `saveCanvasToLocalCache` writes correct JSON with a `timestamp` field |
| *Should retrieve correctly parsed canvas data* | `getCanvasFromLocalCache` reads and parses stored data correctly |
| *Should return null if no cache exists* | Returns `null` for unknown workspace IDs, not an exception |
| *Should clear only the specific workspace cache* | `clearCanvasLocalCache(42)` removes workspace 42's cache but leaves workspace 43's intact |
| *Should handle corrupt JSON gracefully* | Returns `null` and fires `console.warn` instead of crashing the app |

### Testing `localStorage` in Node

Vitest runs in a Node environment where `localStorage` doesn't exist. The tests mock it with a plain object:

```typescript
let mockStorage: Record<string, string> = {};

beforeEach(() => {
    mockStorage = {};
    vi.stubGlobal('localStorage', {
        getItem: vi.fn((key) => mockStorage[key] || null),
        setItem: vi.fn((key, value) => { mockStorage[key] = value; }),
        removeItem: vi.fn((key) => { delete mockStorage[key]; }),
        clear: vi.fn(() => { mockStorage = {}; })
    });
    vi.clearAllMocks();
});
```

This pattern should be reused in any future test that interacts with browser storage APIs.
