Today marks a significant milestone for our team. After months of reflection and growth, we're excited to announce that Meshwork Studio is now **Weave Studio**.

## Why the Change?

As our platform evolved from a simple node editor to a comprehensive visual development environment, we realized our name needed to reflect that transformation. "Weave" captures what our users do best - weaving together ideas, data, and workflows into cohesive applications.

## What's New

- **Refreshed Brand Identity**: New logo, color palette, and visual language
- **Enhanced Canvas Engine**: 40% faster rendering with our new WebGL-based renderer
- **Improved Collaboration**: Real-time cursors and live editing with your team
- **Smart Workspaces**: AI-powered suggestions for node connections

## What Stays the Same

Your existing projects, workspaces, and workflows remain untouched. All URLs redirect seamlessly, and your data is exactly where you left it. The core experience you love - infinite canvas, flexible nodes, rapid prototyping - only gets better.

## Looking Ahead

This rebrand signals our commitment to becoming the definitive visual development platform. Over the coming months, expect:

- Component marketplace for sharing and discovering node templates
- Enhanced integrations with popular databases and APIs
- Mobile companion app for on-the-go project monitoring

Thank you for being part of this journey. We can't wait to see what you weave next.

Real-time collaboration is the holy grail of canvas-based applications. Here's how we built ours.

## The Challenge

When multiple users edit the same canvas simultaneously, conflicts are inevitable. Traditional CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) work well for text, but canvas operations - moving nodes, resizing, creating connections - require a different approach.

## Our Architecture

We implemented an **Operational Transformation** system specifically designed for spatial data:

### 1. Operation Primitives
Every canvas action becomes a typed operation:
- NodeMove - position changes
- NodeResize - dimension changes  
- EdgeCreate - connection creation
- StyleUpdate - visual property changes

### 2. Conflict Resolution
Operations carry metadata about their spatial context. When conflicts occur, we resolve based on:
- **Temporal ordering**: Wall-clock timestamps
- **User priority**: Explicit locks on high-level structural changes
- **Spatial proximity**: Operations affecting different canvas regions can coexist

### 3. Presence System
Beyond just data sync, we track:
- Cursor positions with smooth interpolation
- User viewport awareness (who's looking where)
- Selection state broadcasting

## Performance Optimizations

- **Delta compression**: Only changed properties transmitted
- **Spatial indexing**: Operations filtered by viewport before transmission
- **Debounce with prediction**: Local changes appear immediately, server reconciliation happens in background

## The Result

Sub-50ms latency for all collaborative operations, even with 20+ concurrent editors. The canvas feels local even when shared globally.

    subtitle: "Lessons learned building a flexible node editor with React Flow and custom handles.",

When we started Weave Studio, we chose React Flow as our foundation. Two years later, we've learned a lot about extending and customizing node editors.

## Why React Flow?

We evaluated several options:
- **Rete.js**: Powerful but complex API surface
- **BaklavaJS**: Vue-based, not suitable for our React stack
- **Flowchart.js**: Too limited for our use cases
- **React Flow**: Best balance of flexibility and sane defaults

## Custom Node Types

Our nodes aren't just boxes. We support:

### Data Nodes
- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- API endpoints with configurable methods
- File system watchers

### Logic Nodes  
- Conditional branching with visual flow
- Loop constructs with iteration tracking
- Function definition and reuse

### UI Nodes
- Form builders with drag-and-drop fields
- Chart components with live data binding
- Layout containers with responsive behavior

## Handle System

Standard React Flow uses simple source/target handles. We extended this:

- **Typed connections**: Prevents connecting incompatible data types
- **Multi-handles**: Single node with many inputs/outputs
- **Dynamic handles**: Handles appear/disappear based on configuration
- **Custom handle shapes**: Visual distinction between data types

## Performance at Scale

Our largest user has a canvas with 2,000+ nodes. Here's how we maintain 60fps:

1. **Virtualization**: Only visible nodes rendered to DOM
2. **Web Workers**: Heavy computation (data validation, transformation) offloaded
3. **Debounced State Updates**: Batch rapid changes into single renders
4. **Memoized Components**: Strict memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders

## The Future

We're extracting our node system into a standalone library. If you're building node-based interfaces, stay tuned.

Export functionality bridges the gap between your canvas workspace and the rest of your workflow. Here's how we built ours.

## PNG Export

For quick sharing and documentation:

- **Resolution scaling**: Export at 1x, 2x, or 3x for crisp displays
- **Selection export**: Export just selected nodes or entire canvas
- **Transparent backgrounds**: Optional transparency for overlay use
- **Annotation overlay**: Include or hide UI elements like grid lines

Implementation uses html2canvas with custom element rendering for our node types.

## PDF Export

For formal documentation and presentations:

- **Multi-page**: Large canvases automatically paginate
- **Vector quality**: Text and shapes remain crisp at any zoom
- **Clickable links**: Node hyperlinks preserved in output
- **Custom headers**: Add project name, date, page numbers

Built on jsPDF with custom SVG-to-PDF conversion for node graphics.

## JSON Export

For programmatic access and backups:

- **Complete state**: All node positions, connections, and configurations
- **Schema versioned**: Forward and backward compatibility handled
- **Selective export**: Export subsets of nodes with dependency resolution
- **Minified or pretty**: Choose output format based on use case

## Import Compatibility

All exports are reversible:
- PNG → re-import as image node
- PDF → not re-importable but preserves visual state
- JSON → full round-trip, pick up exactly where you left off

## Coming Soon

- **Figma import**: Bring your designs into Weave Studio
- **Mermaid export**: Generate flowchart code from your canvas
- **Git integration**: Version control for your JSON exports

When you have dozens of workspaces, organization becomes critical. Here's how our new management features help.

## Collections

Group related workspaces into collections:
- **Nested folders**: Unlimited depth for complex hierarchies
- **Shared permissions**: Grant access to entire collections at once
- **Collection templates**: New workspaces inherit collection defaults
- **Bulk actions**: Move, copy, or delete entire collections

## Tags

Cross-cutting organization beyond hierarchy:
- **Color-coded**: Visual distinction at a glance
- **Searchable**: Filter workspaces by any tag combination
- **Auto-suggestions**: Frequently used tags suggested
- **Tag analytics**: See which tags are most used across your team

## Bulk Operations

Save time with multi-select:
- **Select all/none**: One-click selection management
- **Shift-select**: Range selection like your file manager
- **Bulk move**: Reorganize multiple workspaces at once
- **Bulk export**: Download multiple workspaces as zip archive

## Search & Filter

Find workspaces instantly:
- **Full-text search**: Matches titles, descriptions, and node content
- **Date filters**: Find workspaces by creation or modification date
- **Type filters**: Show only API workflows, UI mockups, etc.
- **Recent**: Quick access to your most visited workspaces

## Archiving

Not ready to delete, but don't need it cluttering your view?
- Archive workspaces to remove from main view
- Archived workspaces searchable but hidden by default
- One-click restore when needed
- Automatic archiving after period of inactivity (configurable)

## Team Features

For organizations:
- **Shared collections**: Team-wide project organization
- **Workspace requests**: Request access to any workspace
- **Activity feed**: See what teammates are working on
- **Usage analytics**: Understand team workspace patterns

    title: "Designing for Spatial Thinking",
    subtitle: "Why we chose an infinite canvas over traditional linear interfaces.",
    date: "Jan 28, 2026",
    category: "Design",

    content: `
The human brain didn't evolve to think in lists. It evolved to think in spaces. That's why we built Weave Studio on an infinite canvas.

## The Problem with Linear Interfaces

Traditional development tools force linear thinking:
- Files in directories (tree structures)
- Code in sequence (top to bottom)
- Navigation through breadcrumbs and menus

This doesn't match how we naturally organize complex ideas. Research shows spatial memory is far more powerful than symbolic memory for complex systems.

## Canvas as Cognition

An infinite canvas mirrors how we think:
- **Proximity = relationship**: Things near each other are related
- **Visual patterns**: Shapes and colors convey meaning instantly  
- **Zoom levels**: Detail when needed, overview when planning
- **Multiple paths**: No forced navigation order

## Scientific Backing

Studies consistently show:
- Spatial interfaces reduce cognitive load by 40% for complex tasks
- Users remember location of information 3x better than menu paths
- Parallel exploration leads to more creative solutions
- Visual grouping improves problem decomposition

## Our Design Principles

1. **Infinite, not bounded**: Never run out of space
2. **Zoom, not scroll**: Navigate by zooming to relevant scale
3. **Direct manipulation**: Touch and move, don't navigate menus
4. **Visual persistence**: Things stay where you put them
5. **Context preservation**: See related work while focused on details

## Real User Impact

Beta testers reported:
- "I can hold the entire system in my head now"
- "Finding that one API endpoint takes seconds, not minutes"
- "My team understands my architecture during code review"
- "I spot connections I would have missed in code"

## Trade-offs

Canvas isn't perfect for everything:
- Simple linear workflows might prefer traditional forms
- Keyboard-heavy users need additional shortcuts
- Accessibility requires extra care

We're addressing these with hybrid modes and enhanced accessibility features.

## The Future is Spatial

We believe spatial interfaces will become the norm for complex creative work. Weave Studio is our bet on that future.
