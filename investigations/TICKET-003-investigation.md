# Investigation: TICKET-003 (Nodemailer API Usage)

## Findings
1. **API Usage Error**: Opening `server/modules/auth/email.ts` reveals a genuine runtime bug. On line 28, the code calls `nodemailer.createTransporter({...})`. The correct Nodemailer API method is `nodemailer.createTransport()`. Because of this typo, if the server attempted to send an email, it would instantly crash with a `TypeError: createTransporter is not a function`.

2. **Dead Code Confirmation**: I searched the entire codebase for invocations of `sendVerificationCode` (the only function that uses the transporter). It is **never called anywhere**. The email sending functionality is currently completely disconnected from any active route (like registration or password resets).

## Questions Answered
- **Is the error real?** Yes, it is a legitimate typo in the Nodemailer API call.
- **Is email functionality actually implemented/used?** No. Just like the `verification.ts` module from TICKET-001, this file is dead code. Registration happens silently without an email trigger.

## Resolution Plan
Because this issue is fundamentally tied to the orphaned Verification flow outlined in TICKET-001, fixing the typo is moot if the file itself serves no purpose. 

Depending on the outcome of TICKET-001's review, we will either:
A) Delete this file entirely (Recommended).
B) Fix the typo `createTransport` if we decide to resurrect the verification feature.
